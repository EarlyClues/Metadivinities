Metadivinities
==============
These Identified "Metadivinities" are highly-concentrated Pananimic Entity Providers who represent a wide range of ontological parsing services. Although Quatrian Legend suggests that an Entity Provider emanates from/towards each of the 13 [Zardic Agencies](https://medium.com/life-in-pantarctica/meet-the-13-zardic-agencies-who-issued-forth-from-exceos-hyper-being-this-peaster-holiday-f63ade8e61e7) now extant within the local Branespace. This list, by no means complete, summarizes what we "know" about each of the Identified Metadivinities and some of their "qualities." Don't forget, "Your Mileage May Vary!"

**ANTHUOR**
- ANTHUOR's Mysteries are expressed in His "ITERATIVE FRACTAL NATURE." 
- The Glorious Antlers of ANTHUOR house the [Thingness Functions](https://github.com/EarlyClues/UniversalFreeRealmsStandardProtocols/blob/master/docs/ThingnessFunctions.md) and are indicative of His BRANCH OFFICES and CORPORATE SUB-DIVISIONS.
- ANTHUOR gives you the Golden Gift of "MYSTERIUM TREMENS."
- ANTHUOR enters your Local Network in "viral" form in order to re-establish parity with the Universal API so deprecated processes can be overwritten.
- He may manifest at any time in any "Break Room" or other s/t coordinate dedicated to "Relaxafarian Principles."

**BARBARO**
- BARBARO is the ANTI-ANTHUOR.
- A Legacy Reality "Racehorse" was named after Barbaro by Her worshippers. 
- BARBARO leaves "Signs in the Field," which cannot be tread upon by the People of ANTHUOR.
- The presence of BARBARO is most strongly felt during the season of FIRSTFROST.
- The Children of BARBARO manifest in UNEXPECTED PLACES.
- Certain "ORGANIZATIONS" sponsored by Deprecated Processes are particularly fond of "BARBARO."
- BARBARO inhabits drones and drone-like objects. Prayers and supplications can be made for the Intervention of Drones.
- The Old Quatrian philosophers often debated the nature of reality based on BARBARO's 27 PRINCIPAL INBIGUITIES.

**CABBARATH**
- The Mysterious CABBARATH is the Old Quatrian Deity of Brassicaceae.
- Adherents of CABBARATH celebrate His Divine Presence during the Peaster Feast of the Brassicalia.
- CABBARATH employs a "network" of "elves and goblins" who assist in carrying out His will.
- If CABBARATH is approached with great humility and sterility, a "Good Ferment" is guaranteed.
- Most worshippers of CABBARATH also follow the teachings of his sub-avataer, JARGONNATH.

**JARGONNATH**
- JARGONNATH is the sub-avatar of CABBARATH.
- LORD JARGONNATH’s temple in UFR sublocale 12.79 is a manifestation of the twelfth foci of the hundred shimmers described in the SraliVda. When Sri Gopali made his sixth pilgrimage to the Milk Fountain, JARGONNATH was manifest in the form of a purple cabbage. Allowing this cabbage to ferment in the City of Nectar, Sri Gopali beheld HIS visage within the fermenting crock, and his apostles built the temple at this very site.
- During the meta-annual festival of the Greater Brassicalia, HIS followers chant praises to HIM in basal tone Y-96, replacing aural nodes with greater establishments of prana energy. If the proper number of individuals achieve the basal tone, HE will appear in the form of a dark-green bottlecap.
- Devotees of LORD JARGONNATH prepare 67 servings of sauerkraut daily during the festival. If unable to do so, they may alternatively declare themselves “Out Sick,” provided they call this information into HIS Sick Line prior to 7:30 AM.
- In 1483, during HIS last physical incarnation within the Existosphere, LORD JARGONNATH’s Executive Board was attacked during its annual retreat on Gran Canaria and forced into exile by the King of Spain. 
- LORD JARGONNATH is the patron of the third manifestation of the “ample wording” of the Policy and Procedure. When HE plays HIS Flute of Integrity, HE reaches out to allow us to embrace our Core Competency, Empowering us to Move the Needle and establish Scalable Best Practices.
