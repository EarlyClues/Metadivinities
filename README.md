Metadivinities
==============
These Identified "Metadivinities" are highly-concentrated Pananimic Entity Providers who represent a wide range of ontological parsing services. Although Quatrian Legend suggests that an Entity Provider emanates from/towards each of the 13 [Zardic Agencies](https://medium.com/life-in-pantarctica/meet-the-13-zardic-agencies-who-issued-forth-from-exceos-hyper-being-this-peaster-holiday-f63ade8e61e7) now extant within the local Branespace. This list, by no means complete, summarizes what we "know" about each of the Identified Metadivinities and some of their "qualities." Don't forget, "Your Mileage May Vary!"

**ANTHUOR**
- ANTHUOR's Mysteries are expressed in His "ITERATIVE FRACTAL NATURE." 
- The Glorious Antlers of ANTHUOR house the [Thingness Functions](https://github.com/EarlyClues/UniversalFreeRealmsStandardProtocols/blob/master/docs/ThingnessFunctions.md) and are indicative of His BRANCH OFFICES and CORPORATE SUB-DIVISIONS.
- ANTHUOR gives you the Golden Gift of "MYSTERIUM TREMENS."
- ANTHUOR enters your Local Network in "viral" form in order to re-establish parity with the Universal API so deprecated processes can be overwritten.
- He may manifest at any time in any "Break Room" or other s/t coordinate dedicated to "Relaxafarian Principles."

**BARBARO**
- BARBARO is the ANTI-ANTHUOR.
- A Legacy Reality "Racehorse" was named after Barbaro by Her worshippers. 
- BARBARO leaves "Signs in the Field," which cannot be tread upon by the People of ANTHUOR.
- The presence of BARBARO is most strongly felt during the season of FIRSTFROST.
- The Children of BARBARO manifest in UNEXPECTED PLACES.
- Certain "ORGANIZATIONS" sponsored by Deprecated Processes are particularly fond of "BARBARO."
- BARBARO inhabits drones and drone-like objects. Prayers and supplications can be made for the Intervention of Drones.
- The Old Quatrian philosophers often debated the nature of reality based on BARBARO's 27 PRINCIPAL INBIGUITIES.
